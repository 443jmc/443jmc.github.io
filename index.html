<h1 id="Balance">Balance</h1>
<p><b>Romantic relationships usually happen</b> between two people at similar levels of emotional development.  Once the relationship is established, both partners grow or stagnate together, with roughly equal maturity on both sides of the relationship. Exceptions to this rule are rare, even after decades of marriage. If you think you are significantly more mature, kind, or loving than your partner, you probably aren’t. </p>
<br>
<p><b>We are blind to our own faults,</b> and sensitive to the faults of others. This makes it look like your partner is the problem, when it’s really a 50/50 split. Your partner probably sees you more accurately than you see yourself, and vice-versa. You need a mirror to see your body, and you need another person to see your soul. That person doesn’t have to be your partner, but it’s a good place to start. </p>
<br>
<p><b>You can’t change what you can’t see.</b> Relationships are hard because what you can change is hard to see, and what you can see is hard to change. Your eyes face outward, but your capacity for growth faces inward. The temptation to focus on your partner’s shortcomings (what you can see but can’t change) is the greatest obstacle to relationship repair. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Find a good mirror.</b> Try family, friends, mentors, coaches, and therapists. Beware that if you ask these people to tell you it’s not your fault, they probably will. That feels good in the moment, but it just makes you even more blind. A good book can also be a mirror, see recommendations below. </p>
<br>

<h1 id="Growth">Growth</h1>
<br>
<p><b>Personal Growth</b> is the only way to repair a relationship. Both partners have to become capable of having a better relationship before they can actually have a better relationship. When one partner grows, the other partner is likely to follow. </p>
<br>
<p><b>The best way to help your partner grow</b> is to focus on your own growth. Your growth will clear the way for your partner to grow as well. Attempting to change your partner directly is a “shortcut” that doesn’t work, and distracts you from your own growth. You need to grow out of behaviors and attitudes that enable and support your partner’s immaturity. You get out of your partner’s way by identifying and changing those enabling behaviors. This is a lot harder than it sounds. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Love fuels growth</b> in yourself and others. Resentment encourages stagnation. Love demands honesty, courage, and calm confrontation. It’s not kind or loving to reinforce your partner’s self-deception. Love requires us to do difficult things that encourage growth. Deception and coddling are not love. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Honest confrontation is part of growth.</b> It’s hard to confront your partner, and even harder to confront yourself. Don’t confront your partner more than you confront yourself. Self-confrontation is much more powerful than partner-confrontation. Honest self-confrontation in front of your partner is a fast-pass to growth. </p>

<h1 id="2.  Communication">2.  Communication</h1>
<br>
<p><b>Relationship Repair Communication</b> starts with both partners to sharing three things:</p>
<p>	<b>1.</b> How I see me (perception)</p>
<p>	<b>2.</b> How I see you (perception)</p>
<p>	<b>3.</b> What I want (preference)</p>
<br>
<p><b>It is not easy to listen to you partner’s perception and preferences</b> if they are significantly different from your own. Listening carefully to things you disagree with is the path of growth. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Avoid appeals to outside authority.</b>  Your desires matter because you matter, and that is enough. You don’t need to buttress them with what God thinks, or what your therapist said, or what’s normal, or what “should” be happening. Take ownership of what you see and what you want. You are the one who defines what you see and what you want. Don’t believe anyone who tells you otherwise. </p>
<br>
<p><b>It is absolutely critical</b> for couples to accept the fact that they will never share the same preferences and perceptions. It’s just not going to happen, and being in a relationship with your doppelgänger would be boring anyway. If you are trying to bend your partner to your will, please stop. There is beauty in making room for someone who is different from you. </p>
<br>
<p><b>It’s not easy</b> to be honest about your what you see and what you want without trying to get your partner to agree. Effective communication is about revealing yourself to your partner, not bending their perception to match yours. </p>
<br>
<p><b>”I prefer you use a kinder tone with me”</b> is an example of owning your own preference. You’re not trying to make anyone do anything, you’re just clearly stating what you want. </p>
<br>
<p><b>“I don’t think you have my best interest at heart”</b> is an example of clearly stating a personal perception. Your partner will probably disagree with it, and that’s OK. The point is to be honest about how you see things. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Any two people will always have different perceptions and preferences.</b> There’s no need to convince anyone else that your perception or preference is right, or normal, or acceptable. It’s yours, and you get to define it. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Difficult conversations</b> can be eased by repeating back what the other person said.  This is to enhance understanding, not agreement. It also helps to talk in short sentences, with long pauses. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Communication only works when both partners stay calm.</b> If one of you gets upset, take a short break and then try again. </p>
<br>
<p><b>When you share</b> your perceptions and preferences the other person doesn’t have to agree. In fact they probably won’t! There is a lot of value in sharing something and accepting the other person’s disagreement. There is even more value in really listening to something you disagree with. “You’re not hearing me” usually means “you don’t agree with me and I can’t handle it.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>Anger, frustration, resentment, stonewalling, and withholding affection</b> are the tools of emotional manipulation the we use to attempt to control others. (It doesn’t work.) You can disagree with a someone and still be kind. We use emotional manipulation to prevent others from expressing preferences and perceptions. </p>
<br>
<p><b>It takes courage</b> to tell your partner what you see and what you want, and it takes even more courage to really care about what they see and what they want. We also use emotional manipulation to try to convince the other person that our perceptions and preferences are more important than their perceptions and preferences. This doesn’t work, and it makes everyone miserable. </p>
<br>
<p><b>If you can’t handle differences</b> in perception and preferences, it’s because you need someone else’s approval and agreement to be OK. This is normal, and it’s what makes intimate relationships so hard. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Face to face communication</b> is high intimacy and high anxiety. You can decrease intimacy and anxiety by using video, voice, or text messages. These higher-latency methods allow more time to process and accept what is said. Practicing calm and kind face-to-face conversations is critical for relationship growth. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Write out difficult disclosures</b> ahead of time. Check your intentions:  are you sharing this to show your partner who you really are, or are you trying to cause suffering? After a difficult conversation, write down a script of who said what, and then create a version where you show up as your best self and manage to stay calm. Now you know where you have room to grow!</p>

<h1 id="3. Self-Reinforcing Dynamics">3. Self-Reinforcing Dynamics</h1>
<p><b>Romantic Relationships</b> tend to settle into self-reinforcing dynamics where each partner supports and enables the other’s behavior. These dynamics serve as anxiety-management mechanisms. All of these dynamics can be broken if one of the partners steps out of their role. Here are two common examples:</p>
<ul><li>	Pursuer/Distancer:  one partner tries to soothe anxiety by seeking emotional and physical closeness, while the other tries to soothe anxiety by seeking emotional and physical distance Each side intensifies and reinforces the other. This pattern is found in most relationships. 
</li><li>	Parent/Child:  one partner assumes the role of a scolding parent while the other assumes the role of a rebellious child. The “parent” often scolds the “child” for their childish behavior, thereby reinforcing the dynamic. 
</li></ul>
<br>
<p><b>Self-reinforcing dynamics are two-player games.</b> In the absence of physical abuse, or other extreme constraints, either partner is free to end the game at any time, although there will be consequences to taking thet step. Each role is enabled and encouraged by its counterpart. When one partner steps out of their role, the other usually follows. </p>
<br>

<h1 id="4.  Differences in Desire">4.  Differences in Desire</h1>
<p><b>There is usually a higher-desire partner (HDP) and lower-desire partner (LDP)</b> for each facet of a relationship. It’s common to see an HDP/LDP dynamic in the areas of sex, intimacy, communication, change, growth, and parenting, among others. It’s rare for one partner to be HDP in all facets at the same time. </p>
<br>
<p><b>The LDP has control over the thing they are lower-desire for.</b> Sexual frequency is determined by the LDP for sex. Levels of intimacy and communication are determined by the LDP for each. The LDP for staying together determines how long the relationship lasts. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Higher-Desire Partners</b> often use the thing they are higher-desire for as a way to extract validation. Lower-desire partners often get a sense of self from resisting the HDP. An HDP who uses sex, communication, touch, or gifts as a source of validation will strengthen the resolve of the LDP to offer less of those things. Without personal growth, the HDP/LDP system moves gradually toward the a state where one partner is desperate and fixated, while the other partner is staunchly opposed. </p>
<br>
<p><b>This dynamic is often visible in sex,</b> where it’s common for the LDP to completely lose interest in sex, while HDP becomes obsessed with it. The same pattern can emerge in any other area of the relationship. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Differences in sexual desire</b> can be resolved if both partners become capable of more generous, giving, and abundant sexuality. This requires both the LDP and HDP to develop stronger, more generous desire. The HDP for sex must confront any tendency to lean on sex as a source of validation, while the LDP confronts the tendency to withhold sex as a form of punishment or control. </p>

<h1 id="Mind Mapping">Mind Mapping</h1>
<p><b>Mind Mapping</b> is the process of intuiting another person’s desires and intentions without the need for any explicit communication. Most children begin learning to map minds around the age of four. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Ask your partner how they map your mind.</b> Try to find truth in the answer. There is a good chance that your map of your own mind is less accurate than your partner’s map of your mind. </p>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<h1 id="Intimacy and Anxiety">Intimacy and Anxiety</h1>
<p><b>Anxiety is the currency of intimate relationships.</b> As intimacy increases, anxiety does as well. Most romantic relationships avoid intimacy because of the anxiety that comes along with it</p>
<br>
<p><b>Long-term relationships</b> make us choose between the anxiety of growth, and the anxiety of stagnation. </p>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<h1 id="Validation">Validation</h1>
<p><b>Validation</b> is a sense of okayness, a feeling that you are you are good enough and it’s OK for you to be where you are. As children, we are generally not capable of self-validating or self-referencing, so we learn to seek validation from parents, peers, teachers, coaches, and other people who matter to us. Validation can also be called approval, respect, reassurance, or emotional support. </p>
<br>
<p><b>As we grow into adulthood,</b> we become capable of shifting our primary reference point from what others think of us, to what we think of ourselves:  we move from other-referencing to self-referencing. Intimate relationships encourage us to progress along this path by making us miserable if we don’t.</p>
<br>
<p><b>During the first few months</b> of new relationship, both partners lavish each other with immense quantities of validation. As the relationship matures, this flood of external validation slows t a trickle, and then stops completely. We are left with a choice:  find a new partner, learn how to self-validate, or continue trying (unsuccessfully) to extract validation from your partner. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Most of us</b> spend our lives trying to pretend that we’re better than we really are. This gap between who we are and who we’re pretending to be is what we are trying to fill with external validation. </p>
<br>
<p><b>It’s easier to fool others, than to fool yourself</b> That’s why we put so much effort into convincing others that we’re worthy of their approval and respect. </p>
<br>
<p><b>The Validation Paradox</b> says that the more you need external validation, the less you get it. This happens because people naturally resist being used as a source of external validation. </p>
<br>
<p><b>There is a crucial difference</b> between wanting and needing:  “need” implies a lack of okayness if you don’t get the thing you are seeking. </p>
<br>
<p><b>You have to earn your own self-respect</b> to become capable of self-validation. This means letting go of </p>
<br>
<p><b>Enjoyable long-term relationships</b> can only exist between two people who are capable of self-validation. You can’t really love someone if you depend on them for approval. </p>
