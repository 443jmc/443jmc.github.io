<h1 id="1.  Balance, Growth, and Confrontation">1.  Balance, Growth, and Confrontation</h1>
<br>
<p><b>Romantic relationships</b> always happen between two people at similar levels of emotional maturity.  Once the relationship is established, both partners grow or stagnate together. There is an equal level of maturity and immaturity on both sides of the relationship. Exceptions to this rule are extremely rare, even after decades of marriage. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Personal Growth</b> is the only way to repair a relationship. Both partners have to become capable of having a better relationship before they can actually have a better relationship. This growth might be the hardest thing you have ever done, and it’s well worth the effort. When one partner begins to grow up, the other partner is likely to follow. </p>
<br>
<p><b>The best way to help your partner grow</b> is to focus on your own growth. Your growth will clear the way for your partner to grow as well. Attempting to change your partner directly is a “shortcut” that doesn’t work, and distracts you from your own growth. You need to grow out of behaviors and attitudes that enable and support your partners’ immaturity. You get out of your partner’s way by identifying and changing those enabling behaviors. </p>
<br>
<p><b>We are blind to our own faults</b>, and incredibly perceptive of the faults of others. This makes it look like your partner is the problem. If you think you’re significantly more mature, kind, or loving than your partner, you probably aren’t. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Love fuels growth</b> in yourself and in others. Resentment encourages stagnation. Love demands honesty, courage, and calm confrontation. It’s not kind or loving to reinforce your partner’s self-deception. Love requires us to do difficult things that encourage growth. Coddling is not love. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Honest confrontation is part of growth.</b> It’s hard to confront your partner, and even harder to confront yourself. Don’t confront your partner more than you confront yourself. Self-confrontation is much more powerful than partner-confrontation. Honest self-confrontation in front of your partner is a path to growth. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Your partner probably sees you more accurately than you see yourself.</b> They can tell you what is unattractive about you, and what is hard about being in a relationship with you. If you really want to grow, ask your partner to help you see where to start, and look for truth their answer. </p>

<h1 id="2.  Communication">2.  Communication</h1>
<br>
<p><b>Relationship Repair Communication</b> requires both partners to share and listen to three key points:</p>
<p>	<b>1.</b> How I see me (perception)</p>
<p>	<b>2.</b> How I see you (perception)</p>
<p>	<b>3.</b> What I want (preference)</p>
<br>
<p><b>Avoid appeals to outside authority.</b>  Your desires matter because they are yours, and because you matter. You don’t need to buttress them what God wants, what’s normal, or what “should” be happening. Take ownership of you see and what you want. </p>
<br>
<p><b>It’s not easy</b> to be honest about your what you see and what you want without trying to get your partner to agree. Effective communication is about revealing yourself to your partner, not getting them to see things the same way. </p>
<br>
<p><b>”I prefer you use a kinder tone with me”</b> is an example of owning your own preference. You’re not trying to make anyone do anything, you’re just clearly stating what you want. “I don’t think you have my best interest at heart” is an example of clearly stating a personal perception. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Two people will always have different perceptions and preferences,</b> and that’s OK. There’s no need to convince anyone else that your perception or preference is right, or acceptable, or normal, or acceptable. It’s yours, and you get to define it. Trust your own preferences and perceptions. It’s hard to face the reality of how much we disagree, and that makes honest communication hard. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Difficult conversations</b> can be eased by repeating back what the other person said.  This is to ensure understanding, not agreement. </p>
<br>
<p><b>When you share</b> your perceptions and preferences the other person doesn’t have to agree. In fact they probably won’t! There is a lot of value in sharing something and accepting the other person’s disagreement. There is even more value in really listening to something you disagree with. “You’re not hearing me” usually means “you don’t agree with me and I can’t handle it.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>Anger, stonewalling, and withholding affection</b> are tools of emotional manipulation, used to control others. You can strongly disagree with a someone and still be kind. We use emotional manipulation to prevent others from expressing preferences and perceptions, and to do things our way. It takes courage to tell your partner what you see and what you want, and it takes even more courage to really care about what they see and what they want. We also use emotional manipulation to try to convince the other person that our perceptions and preferences are better than their perceptions and preferences. This doesn’t work, and it makes everyone miserable. </p>
<br>
<p><b>If you can’t handle differences</b> in perception and preferences, it’s because you need someone else’s approval and agreement to be OK. This is normal, and it’s what makes intimate relationships so hard. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Face to face communication</b> is high intimacy and high anxiety. You can decrease intimacy and anxiety by using video, voice, or text messages. This also allows more time to process what is said. Practicing calm and honest face-to-face conversations is critical for relationship growth. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Write out difficult disclosures</b> ahead of time. Check your intentions:  are you sharing this to show your partner who you really are, or are you trying to cause suffering? Maybe a bit of both? After a difficult conversation, write down a script of who said what, and then create a version where you show up as your best self and somehow manage to stay calm. Now you know where you have room to grow!</p>

<h1 id="3. Self-Reinforcing Dynamics">3. Self-Reinforcing Dynamics</h1>
<p><b>Romantic Relationships</b> tend to settle into self-reinforcing dynamics where each partner supports and enables the other’s behavior. These dynamics serve as anxiety-management mechanisms. All of these dynamics can be broken if one of the partners steps out of their role. Here are three examples:</p>
<br>
<p><b>1. Pursuer-Distancer:</b>  one partner tries to soothe anxiety by seeking emotional and physical closeness, while the other tries to soothe anxiety by seeking emotional and physical distance Each side intensifies and reinforces the other. This pattern is found in most relationships. </p>
<p><b>2. Leader-Follower:</b> One partner leads and the other follows. Both partners may complain about the role they play, but neither is willing to change behavior. </p>
<p><b>3. Parent-Child</b> One partner assumes the role of a scolding, judgmental parent while the other assumes the role of a rebellious child. Both roles may be played overtly, or the behavior may be more hidden. </p>
<br>
<p><b>These are all two-player games</b> and either participant can change the rules at any time. Each role is enabled and encouraged by its counterpart. When one partner steps out of their assigned role, the other will follow. </p>
<br>

<h1 id="4.  Differences in Desire">4.  Differences in Desire</h1>
<p><b>There is usually a high-desire partner (HDP) and low-desire partner (LDP)</b> for each facet of a relationship. It’s common to see an HDP/LDP dynamic in the areas of sex, intimacy, communication, change, growth, and parenting, among others. It’s rare for one partner to be HDP in all facets at the same time. </p>
<br>
<p><b>The LDP is controls the thing they are low-desire for.</b> Sexual frequency is determined by LDP for sex. Levels of intimacy and communication are determined by the LDP for each. The LDP for staying together determines whether you stay together or not. </p>
<br>
<p><b>High-Desire Partners</b> often get a sense of self from the thing they are high-desire for. Low-desire partners often get a sense of self from resisting the HDP. For example, the partner who wants more sex may be relying on sex as a source of validation or okayness. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Differences in sexual desire</b> can be resolved if both partners become capable of more generous, giving, and abundant sexuality. This requires both the LDP and HDP to develop stronger, more generous desire. </p>

<h1 id="Mind Mapping">Mind Mapping</h1>
<p><b>Mind Mapping</b> is the process of intuiting another person’s desires and intentions, far beyond what is communicated through words. Most children begin learning to map minds around the age of four. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Ask your partner how they map your mind.</b> Try to find truth in the answer. There is a good chance that your map of your own mind is less accurate than your partner’s map of your mind. </p>
<br>
<h1 id="Intimacy and Anxiety">Intimacy and Anxiety</h1>
<p><b>Anxiety is the currency of intimate relationships.</b> As intimacy increases, anxiety does as well. Most romantic relationships avoid intimacy because of the anxiety that comes along with it</p>
<br>
<p><b>Long-term relationships</b> make us choose between the anxiety of growth, and the anxiety of stagnation. </p>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<h1 id="Validation">Validation</h1>
<p><b>Validation</b> is a sense of okayness, a feeling that you are you are good enough and it’s OK for you to be where you are. As children, we are generally not capable of self-validating or self-referencing, so we learn to seek validation from parents, peers, teachers, coaches, and other people who matter to us. Validation can also be called approval, respect, reassurance, or emotional support. </p>
<br>
<p><b>As we grow into adulthood,</b> we become capable of shifting our primary reference point from what others think of us, to what we think of ourselves:  we move from other-referencing to self-referencing. Intimate relationships encourage us to progress along this path by making us miserable if we don’t.</p>
<br>
<p><b>During the “honeymoon phase”</b> at the beginning of a new relationship, both partners lavish each other with never-ending external validation. As the relationship matures, this flood of external validation slows t a trickle, and then stops completely. We are left with a choice:  find a new partner, learn how to self-validate, or continue trying (unsuccessfully) to extract validation from your partner. </p>
<br>
<p><b>You have to earn your own self-respect</b> before you can self-validated. That means figuring out what kind of person you want to be, and then working to close the gap between who you want to be, and who you are. That gap is the space you are trying to fill with external validation. </p>
<br>
<p><b>It’s easier to fool others, than to fool yourself</b> That’s why we put so much effort into convincing others we’re worthy of their approval and respect. It’s more difficult, and more effective, to seek internal validation. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Enjoyable long-term relationships</b> can only exist between two people who are capable of self-validation. You can’t really love someone if you depend on them for approval. </p>
