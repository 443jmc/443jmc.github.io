<h1 id="Principles of Love an Marriage">Principles of Love an Marriage</h1>
<br>
<h2 id="Balance, Growth, and Confrontation">Balance, Growth, and Confrontation</h2>
<br>
<p><b>Intimate relationships</b> happen between two people at similar levels of emotional maturity.  Both partners either grow or stagnate together. There is an even balance of total maturity on both sides of the relationship. Exceptions to this rule are extremely rare, even after decades of marriage. Exceptions to this rule are extremely rare. Severe mental illness is the most common exception. </p>
<br>
<p><b>The best way to help your partner grow</b> is to focus on your own growth. As you grow, your partner will often follow suit. Attempting to change your partner directly is a “shortcut” that doesn’t work. There are probably things you are doing that are enabling and supporting your partner’s immature behavior. You can get out of your partner’s way by identifying and changing those enabling behaviors. </p>
<br>
<p><b>We tend to be blind to our own faults</b>, and really good at seeing faults in others. This makes it seem like your partner is the problem. Even if it seems like you’re much more mature, kind, or loving than your partner, you probably aren’t. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Love fuels growth</b> in yourself and in others. Resentment and anger create stagnation. Love demands honesty, courage, and even confrontation. It’s not loving to support your partner’s self-deception. Love includes doing difficult and uncomfortable things that encourage growth. Love and coddling are not the same. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Honest confrontation is part of growth.</b> It’s hard to honestly confront a partner, and even harder to honestly confront yourself. Maintain a 50/50 balance between self-confrontation and partner confrontation. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Your partner can see you better than you can see yourself.</b> Ask them what is hard about being with you, and what is unattractive about you. Tell them the same things, with as much kindness as possible. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="Communication">Communication</h2>
<br>
<p><b>Relationship Repair Communication</b> requires both partners to share and listen to three key points:</p>
<p>	<b>1.</b> How I see myself (perception)</p>
<p>	<b>2.</b> How I see you (perception)</p>
<p>	<b>3.</b> What I want (preference)</p>
<br>
<p><b>It takes about a minute</b> to share your perceptions and preferences. If you’re upset and your conversation lasts more than two minutes, there’s probably a lot of manipulation going on. Take a break, calm down, and try again. Or just accept the fact that you disagree with each other, and go from there. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Two people will always have</b> different perceptions and preferences, and that’s OK. There’s no need to convince anyone else that your perception or preference is right, or acceptable, or normal, or acceptable. It’s yours, and you get to define it. Trust your own preferences and perceptions. It’s hard to face the reality of how much we disagree, and that makes honest communication hard. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Extremely difficult conversations</b> can be eased by repeating back what the other person said.  This is to ensure understanding, not agreement. </p>
<br>
<p><b>When you share</b> your perceptions and preferences the other person doesn’t have to agree. In fact they probably won’t! There is a lot of value in sharing something and accepting the other person’s disagreement. There is even more value in really listening to something you disagree with. “You’re not hearing me” usually means “you don’t agree with me and I can’t handle it.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>Anger, stonewalling, and withholding affection</b> are tools of emotional manipulation, used to control others. Too bad they don’t work! You can strongly disagree with a someone and still be kind. We use emotional manipulation to prevent others from expressing preferences and perceptions. It takes courage to tell your partner what you see and what you want, and it takes even more courage to really care about what they see and what they want. We also use emotional manipulation to try to convince the other person that our perceptions and preferences are better than their perceptions and preferences. This doesn’t work, and it makes everyone miserable. </p>
<br>
<p><b>If you can’t handle differences</b> in perception and preferences, it’s because you need someone else’s approval and agreement to be OK. This is normal, and it’s what makes intimate relationships so hard. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Face to face communication</b> is high intimacy and high anxiety. You can decrease intimacy and anxiety by using video, voice, or text messages. This also allows more time to process what is said. Practicing calm and honest face-to-face conversations is critical for relationship growth. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Write out difficult disclosures</b>ahead of time. Check your intentions:  are you sharing this to show your partner who you really are, or are you trying to cause suffering? Maybe a bit of both? After a difficult conversation, write down a script of who said what, and then create a version where you show up as your best self and somehow manage to stay calm. Now you know where you have room to grow!</p>
