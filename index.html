<h1 id="Validation">Validation</h1>
<p><b>Validation</b> is a sense of personal sufficiency, worthiness, approval, respect, and reassurance.</p>
<br>
<p><b>External referencing</b>, the process of looking to others for validation, is normal in children and adolescents. Adults learn to self-reference by earning their own self-respect instead of relying on external validation. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Your local high school</b> is a great place to observe external referencing. Adolescents put a lot of effort into earning validation from others because they are not capable of self-validation. Adolescents who receive less validation from parents, coaches, and teachers often work harder to get validation from their peers. </p>
<br>
<p><b>People-pleasing</b> is a way of extracting validation from others. There is a difference between doing what someone else wants out of love, and doing it to get validation. People-pleasers feel intense pressure to align with what other people want. That pressure is the need for external validation. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Differentiation</b> is the ability to hold onto yourself when the important people in your life pressure you to conform. </p>
<br>
<p><b>You have to reveal the less flattering parts of yourself</b> to people who matter to you if you want to earn your own self-respect. We usually hide those parts because they would get in the way of extracting validation.</p>
<br>
<p><b>We don’t want important people to see our weaker parts</b> because that decreases our ability to extract validation from them. This </p>
<br>
<p><b>Deception drives external referencing</b> and external referencing drives deception, creating a vicious cycle:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>You deceive others to extract validation from them
</li><li>Deception decreases self-respect
</li><li>Decreased self-respect increases your need for external validation
</li><li>Rinse and repeat
</li></ol>
<br>
<p><b>Honesty drives internal referencing</b> and internal referencing drives honesty, creating a virtuous cycle:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>You present yourself honestly to others, even if it’s not pretty
</li><li>Honesty increases self-respect
</li><li>Increased self-respect decreases your need for external validation
</li><li>Rinse and repeat
</li></ol>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<h1 id="Relationship Timelines">Relationship Timelines</h1>
<p><b>New relationships are magical validation machines,</b> but this is a temporary state. When it ends, you only have two choices:  start a new relationship to reset the clock, or start learning to self-validate.</p>
<br>
<p><b>No amount of “I statements” or “love languages”</b> will restart the external validation machine once it has stopped. These ideas are useful, but only when they are accompanied by self-validation. </p>
<br>
<p><b>The more you need validation from your partner,</b>, the less you will get it. The less you need validation from your partner, the more you will get. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Happily-married people validate each other constantly,</b> but they do not depend on that validation, or try to extract it from each other. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Satisfying long-term relationships</b> always require self-validation. You can’t really love someone when you need them to approve of you.  Long-term relationships encourage us to self-reference by making us miserable if we don’t. </p>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<h1 id="Balance">Balance</h1>
<p><b>Romantic relationships usually happen</b> between two people at similar levels of emotional development.  Once the relationship is established, both partners grow or stagnate together. If you think you are significantly more (or less) mature, kind, or loving than your partner, you probably aren’t. Exceptions to this rule are rare, even in multi-decade marriages. </p>
<br>
<p><b>We are blind to our own faults,</b> and sensitive to the faults of others. This makes it look like your partner is the problem, when it’s really a 50/50 split. Your partner probably sees you more accurately than you see yourself, and vice-versa. You need a mirror to see your body, and you need another person to see your soul. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Relationships are hard</b> because what you can see (your partner) is not what you can change (yourself.) The temptation to focus on your partner’s shortcomings (what you can see but can’t change) is the greatest obstacle to relationship repair. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Find a mirror for your soul.</b> Ask your partner what’s hard about being with you. Family, friends, mentors, coaches, and therapists can help if they’re honest. A good book can also help, see recommendations below. </p>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<h1 id="Growth">Growth</h1>
<br>
<p><b>Personal Growth</b> is the only way to repair a relationship. Both partners have to become more capable of loving each other for the relationship to improve.  When one partner grows, the other partner usually follows. </p>
<br>
<p><b>The best way to help your partner grow</b> is to focus on your own growth.  Attempting to change your partner directly is a “shortcut” that doesn’t work, and it distracts you from your own growth. You need to grow out of behaviors and attitudes that enable and support your partner’s immaturity. Identifying and changing those enabling behaviors gets you out of your partner’s way. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Focus on your own growth</b> because that’s where your power lies. Even if you think your partner is responsible for 80% of the difficulty in your relationship, your power still lies in the 20% you can actually change. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Love fuels growth</b> in yourself and others, while resentment encourages stagnation. Love demands honesty, courage, and calm confrontation. Deception and coddling are not love. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Honest confrontation is part of growth.</b> It’s hard to confront your partner, and even harder to confront yourself, and self-confrontation is more powerful than partner-confrontation. Self-confrontation in front of your partner is the fast lane to personal growth. </p>
<br>
<p> </p>

<br>
<br>
<h1 id="Communication">Communication</h1>
<br>
<p><b>Relationship Repair Communication</b> focuses on three points:</p>
<p>	<b>1.</b> How I see myself (perception)</p>
<p>	<b>2.</b> How I see you (perception)</p>
<p>	<b>3.</b> What I want (preference)</p>
<br>
<p><b>No two human beings</b> will ever share the same preferences and perceptions. If you have been trying to convince your partner that your perception is more accurate than theirs, please stop. There is beauty in making room for someone who sees things differently and wants different things. We end up living in a small world when we can’t make room for different perceptions and preferences. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Be honest about what you see and what you want</b> without trying to get your partner to agree. Effective communication is about revealing yourself to your partner, not bending their preference and perception to match yours. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Difficult conversations</b> can be eased by repeating back your understanding of what the other person said.  This is to enhance understanding, not agreement. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Communication only works when both partners stay calm.</b> If one of you gets upset, take a break and try again. </p>
<br>
<p><b>When you share</b> your perceptions and preferences the other person doesn’t have to agree. In fact they probably won’t! There is a lot of value in sharing something and accepting the other person’s disagreement. There is even more value in really listening to something you disagree with. “You’re not hearing me” usually means “you don’t agree with me and I can’t handle it.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>Avoid appeals to outside authority.</b>  Your preferences matter because you matter. You don’t need to buttress them with what “should” be happening. Take ownership of what you see and what you want. “This is what I want” is a stronger position than “this is how things should be.” </p>
<br>
<p><b>Anger, frustration, resentment, stonewalling, and withholding affection</b> are the tools of emotional manipulation the we use to control others. You can disagree with someone and still be kind. We use emotional manipulation to prevent others from expressing preferences and perceptions, and to bend them to our way of seeing things. It doesn’t work. </p>
<br>
<p><b>It takes courage</b> to tell your partner what you see and what you want, and it takes even more courage to really care about what they see and what they want. We also use emotional manipulation to try to convince the other person that our perceptions and preferences are more important than their perceptions and preferences. This doesn’t work, and it makes everyone miserable. </p>
<br>
<p><b>If you can’t handle differences</b> in perception and preferences, it’s because you need someone else’s agreement to be OK. This is normal, and it’s what makes intimate relationships so hard. Most lovers’ quarrels are just attempts to extract validation from each other.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Face to face communication</b> is high intimacy and high anxiety. You can decrease intimacy and anxiety by using video, voice, or text messages. These higher-latency methods allow more time to process and accept what is said. Practicing calm and kind face-to-face conversations is critical for relationship growth. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Write out difficult disclosures</b> ahead of time. Check your intentions:  are you sharing this to show your partner who you really are, or are you trying to cause suffering? After a difficult conversation, write down a script of who said what, and then create a version where you show up as your best self and manage to stay calm. Now you know where you have room to grow!</p>
<br>
<p><b>”I understand and I disagree”</b> is a way of clearing the ground between listening and agreeing. “You’re not hearing me” usually means “you don’t agree with me and I can’t handle it.”</p>
<br>
<p><b>”I don’t need you to agree with me”</b> is a way to remind your partner that they get to have their own perception and preferences.</p>
<br>
<p><b>”I prefer you use a kinder tone with me”</b> is an example of owning your own preference. You’re not trying to make anyone do anything, you’re just clearly stating what you want. </p>
<br>
<p><b>“I don’t think you have my best interest at heart”</b> is an example of clearly stating a personal perception. Your partner will probably disagree with it, and that’s OK. The point is to be honest about how you see things. </p>
<br>

<br>
<h1 id="Self-Reinforcing Dynamics">Self-Reinforcing Dynamics</h1>
<p><b>Romantic Relationships</b> often settle into self-reinforcing dynamics where each partner supports and enables the other’s behavior. These dynamics last until one person steps out of their role. Here are two common examples:</p>
<ul><li>	Pursuer/Distancer:  one partner tries to soothe anxiety by seeking emotional and physical closeness, while the other tries to soothe anxiety by seeking emotional and physical distance Each side intensifies and reinforces the other. This pattern is found in most relationships. 
</li><li>	Parent/Child:  one partner assumes the role of a scolding parent while the other assumes the role of a rebellious child. The “parent” often scolds the “child” for their childish behavior, thereby reinforcing the dynamic. 
</li></ul>
<br>
<p><b>Self-reinforcing dynamics are two-player games.</b> In the absence of physical abuse, or other extreme constraints, either partner is free to end the game at any time. Each role is enabled and encouraged by its counterpart. When one partner steps out of their role, the other usually follows. </p>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<h1 id="Differences in Desire">Differences in Desire</h1>
<p><b>There is usually a higher-desire partner (HDP) and lower-desire partner (LDP)</b> for each area of a relationship. It’s common to see an HDP/LDP dynamic in the areas of sex, intimacy, communication, growth, and parenting, among others. It’s rare for one partner to be HDP in all areas.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The LDP has control over the thing they are lower-desire for.</b> The frequency and intensity of sex, intimacy, and communication are determined by the LDP for each. The LDP for staying together determines how long the relationship lasts. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Higher-Desire Partners</b> often use the thing they are higher-desire for as a way to extract validation from the LDP. Lower-desire partners often get a sense of self from resisting the HDP. An HDP who uses sex, communication, touch, or gifts as a source of validation is encouraging the LDP to offer less of those things. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Differences in sexual desire</b> can be resolved if both partners become capable of more generous, giving, and abundant sexuality. This requires both the LDP and HDP to develop stronger, more generous desire. The HDP for sex must confront the urge to use sex as a source of validation, while the LDP confronts the urge to withhold sex as a form of punishment or control.  There is often a good reason for the LDP to not want the sex that is being offered. </p>

<br>
<h1 id="Mind Mapping">Mind Mapping</h1>
<p><b>Mind Mapping</b> is the process of intuiting another person’s desires and intentions without the need for any explicit communication. Most children begin learning to map minds around the age of four. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Ask your partner how they map your mind.</b> Try to find truth in the answer. There is a good chance that your map of your own mind is less accurate than your partner’s map of your mind. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Mind mapping makes it hard to deceive your partner.</b> The difference between who you are, and who you pretend to be, is more visible than you think. “I never said that” is the usual response when one partner maps the other accurately, and the other doesn’t like it. </p>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<h1 id="Intimacy and Anxiety">Intimacy and Anxiety</h1>
<p><b>Anxiety is the currency of intimate relationships.</b> As intimacy increases, anxiety does as well. Most romantic relationships avoid intimacy because of the anxiety that comes along with it. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Intimacy is to know, and to be known.</b> Intimacy grows when we remove our masks and allow our parters to see us as we truly are. It shrinks when we try to hide from each other. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Intimacy is not for the faint of heart.</b> It requires the ability to be OK with who you really are, even if your partner doesn’t approve. </p>
